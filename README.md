> **Abstract:** *A lightweight underwater image enhancement network is of great significance for resource-constrained platforms, but balancing model size, computational efficiency, and enhancement performance has proven difficult for previous approaches. In this work, we propose the Five A+ Network （FA+Net）, a highly efficient and lightweight real-time underwater image enhancement network with only 9k parameters and ~0.01s processing time. The FA+Net employs a two-stage enhancement structure. The strong prior stage aims to decompose challenging underwater degradations into sub-problems, while the fine-grained stage incorporates multi-branch color enhancement module and pixel attention module to amplify the network's perception of details. To the best of our knowledge, FA+Net is the only network with the capability of real-time enhancement of 1080P images. Thorough extensive experiments and comprehensive visual comparison, we show that FA+Net outperforms previous approaches by obtaining state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets while significantly reducing both parameter count and computational complexity.*
